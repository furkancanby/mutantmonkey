# perimelis - TCP Bidirectional Bandwidth Test

<br/>
It is a bidirectional (full-duplex) bandwidth test. <br/>
This project is currently developing by me. <br/>
We have one server and one client side. You can run them with "-s"/"-c". <br/>
If you will get an unexpected results, try to change buffer and testdata sizes (about byte size).<br/>
Warning : All features may not work perfectly. Forgive me :)
